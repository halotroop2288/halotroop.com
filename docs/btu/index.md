# Better Than Updates

[Better Than Updates] is a modding toolchain for Minecraft version Beta 1.7.3.

The main goal is to have a stable modding toolchain for one specific version of Minecraft,
so that updating the game is unnecessary and modding the game is easy.

At the moment, BTU has two active projects, but it was also meant to have one more.

The active projects are [Apron] and [Yarn Beta].

The last project, Fabric Beta Essentials is intended to replace the existing modding APIs for beta 1.7.3,
and add several quality of life and acessibility features as well.
Such as a built-in mod menu, translatable text with a backport of the language setting,
and fixes for bugs that cropped up over the years of unmaintenance.<br>
Fabric Beta Essentials does not have any active contributors,
as [Better Than Updates] was [Caroline]'s passion project until she decided to
[stop modding Minecraft](/caroline/projects/dead).
