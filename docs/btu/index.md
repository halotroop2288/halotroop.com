# Better Than Updates

Better Than Updates is a modding toolchain for Minecraft version Beta 1.7.3.

The main goal is to have a stable modding toolchain for one specific version of Minecraft,
so that updating the game is unnecessary and modding the game is easy.

At the moment, BTU has two active projects, but it was also meant to have one more.

The active projects are [Apron] and [Yarn Beta].
