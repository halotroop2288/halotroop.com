# Caroline's Art Gallery

This is a gallery of images of my [fursona, Caroline](/caroline/fursona.md). Enjoy!


## Art by [Zaezar](https://www.zaezardraws.com)

Anything without a story here is probably a freebie,
becuase Zaezar frequently has freebie raffle art streams
and there used to be a lot fewer participants,
to the point where it was almost a guaranteed win.
I still participate in these sometimes, but it's much less common to win.

### Pre-design

This art is from before I had a reference!
The art didn't follow a specific design, just what I told Zaezar the character looked like.

#### 2017

This is the first piece of art I ever commissioned.
I wish I had the foresight to wait for an official reference.

### Post-design

In 2018, I actually commissioned a reference sheet for Caroline and thus she finally had an official design!

#### 2018

If you ever make art of Caroline, you should use this reference:

## Art by [FelisRandomis](https://www.furaffinity.net/user/felisrandomis/)

This is some art I commissioned just so I could see some more expressions from my fursona.
![Headshots](/caroline/images/headshots_by_felis.png "Three headshots: Angry, Sad, and Blushing with rolled back eyes - July 2018")

This one was done only on a Telegram channel that Felis used to run.

The avatar shown on this website was created by VI Felian, aka Parasyminus.
He is the artist that I most recommend, if you are looking for any for yourself!

Here is the full version of it:

## Art by [Galinn](https://twitter.com/ArtsGalinn)

#### 2022

Apparently I was the first ever follower of Galinn on Twitter.
So they made me this as a "thank you" at their 2,000 follower milestone!

## Removals

Some art has been removed due to my negative relationship with the artist(s).
Sorry, if you're disappointed, but this is how I want it to be.

# Other art

Later, I'm going to add some other art that was drawn for me.
Such as pre-ref art that actually became its own character!
