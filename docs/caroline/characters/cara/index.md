# Cara M. M.

Cara is a severely underdeveloped character I forced myself to make up
when I realized I had only ever though of three original characters.

I had, at one time, wrote up whole bios for all of my characters, including this one.
But I don't know where I saved that, and I probably wouldn't agree with it now anyway.
It's lost to time, at this point.

When I wrote up those character bios, I came up with a
first, middle and last name based on the initials of one of my friends.
I can't remember the middle or last name now. But I do remember making this character.

# Characteristics
