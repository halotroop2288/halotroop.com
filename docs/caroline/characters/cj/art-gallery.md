# CJ's Art Gallery

This is a gallery of images of my fursona's masculine alter-ego [CJ] [Bell](/caroline/characters/cj).


## Art by [Zaezar](https://www.zaezardraws.com)

As of September 2022, there is only three pieces of art that make up [CJ]'s character, all made in 2017 by Zaezar.<br/>
My primary focus has been to develop [Caroline] as much as possible first and foremost.

### 2017
