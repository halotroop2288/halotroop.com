*CJ* is the more masculine alter-ego of [Caroline].<br>
He came about accidentally, as [I] entered [Caroline] art raffles
without a proper reference sheet back in 2017.<br>
At first, I was annoyed that it didn't fit my vision for [Caroline],
but I've grown to like this character on his own merits.

He has his own [art gallery](art-gallery), but hasn't been developed as a character as well as [Caroline]
or gotten as much [art](../caroline/art-gallery) as her since she got an official reference sheet.

## Characteristics

For lack of a true reference for his design as a character,
here's what we know about CJ:

### Physical

- Feline
- Dark red fur (#8C281C)
- Short dark brown hair (#2B1613)
- Pale white skin (#FAEEED) (as seen inside his ears)
- Blue eyes (#2A6DF9), but flat instead of gradient like his female counterpart
- ? chest
- ? tail
- ? legs

### Personality

- He/Him (or They/Them)
- Favorite color: Red
- Always wears a hoodie

As far as his personality goes, I have no idea. Caroline is mostly a self-insert or a reflection of myself. CJ is a part of me that I rarely identify with.

We can see that he is portrayed as a goofball in at least one of his portraits, pulling his drawstrings closed over his face.<br>

This was the last development of CJ before Zaezar started drawing Caroline on-model all the time.
