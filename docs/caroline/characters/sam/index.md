Sam is a character that once upon a time had a somewhat thought-out backstory.
This back-story was deleted as it was only posted in my archived Discord server,
which was deleted when my acccount was stolen by a well-known 

This art was made by someone on Facebook before I stopped using it and deactivated my account.
I don't remember the person's name, unfortunately. But here is my digitized, colored version:
![A headshot of a light blue dog with green eyes and prominent very dark blue eyebrows and white fluff](images/sam_by_unknown.png "Sam is a Furry - ???, halotroop2288 - February 2017, November 2017")

This drawing was actually the basis for the entire character,
after the person it was based on refused to take ownership of it.
It was originally meant as a joke, but I thought that person might like it.

Now, she's officially a character of Basuoland.
