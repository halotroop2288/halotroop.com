Violet is the second character I thought up, while creating [Basuoland].

She is the oldest daughter of [Caroline] at around 15.
She's very protective of her sister, [Ashley].

Violet has no official art, and originated as a product of the *RPG Maker VX Ace* character generator.

## Characteristics

Since I can't show you Violet, here's what I can tell you about how I imagine her:

- Fairy Cat
- she/her
- Favorite color: Purple
- Purple fur
- Pink skin(?)
- Light Mage (practices conjuring and restoration)
- Practices archery as a backup skill
- Wears a wizard's hat and robe, both purple
- Dark blue eyes
- Good-natured
- Loves her sister as her best friend
- Super long tail, like her mom
- Neutral-good
- Confident
