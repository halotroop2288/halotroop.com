# Caroline

Hi, I'm Caroline, and this is my website. :caroline-smile:

I'm a non-binary trans woman
who used to make Minecraft mods,
and (tried) to make video games.

My [pronouns] are She/Her.
But I'd prefer if you'd just *not* refer to me indirectly, where possible.

I am a virtual sandbox enthusiast.
I used to mod games (mostly Minecraft), and designed my own games sometimes.
But [I never found any happiness in it.](projects/dead/#Retirement_from_programming)

This section is about me, myself, and I. A sort of introduction to me.
In the following sections, you can find out more about my life by following me on my social medias below.
<!-- reading my [blog], -->
Check out [my fursona] and other characters,
and reading about my [projects](projects),
both the alive, and the [dead](projects/dead)!

There's also an [art gallery](art-gallery)
of [my fursona]<!--, my [blog]-->
and in case you want to chat, [here's a link](https://rvlt.gg/EmND69QW)
to my [Revolt](https://revolt.chat) guild.

If none of that suits your fancy, you can still follow me on social media, below.

??? info "Social Media"
    If you feel so inclined, you can follow me on social media,
    where I will make updates far more frequently, as it takes way less effort!

    I used to use Twitter, but after it was bought by Elongated Muskrat, the site became unusable, and the site policies became transphobic. Join the Fediverse today!
