Hi, I'm Caroline, and this is my website. :caroline-smile:<br>
My [pronouns] are she/her.

I'm a non-binary trans woman, a virtual sandbox enthusiast, and I still (try to) make video games.<br>
I used to make mods for Minecraft, but I've never found any happiness in it, so I stopped in 2022.

This section is about me, myself, and I. A sort of introduction to me.
In the following sections, you can find out more about my life
by following me on my social media pages below.

Check out [my fursona] and other characters,
and reading about my [projects](projects),
both the alive, and the [dead](projects/dead)!<br>
There's also an [art gallery](art-gallery) of [my fursona], an experimental [videos] page,
and in case you want to chat, [here's a link](https://rvlt.gg/EmND69QW)
to my [Revolt](https://revolt.chat) guild.<br>
When you're done with that, you can follow me on social media, by using the links below.

??? info "Social Media"
    If you feel so inclined, you can follow me on social media,
    where I will make updates far more frequently, as it takes way less effort!

    I used to use Twitter, but after it was bought by Elongated Muskrat, the site became unusable, and the site policies became transphobic. Join the Fediverse today!
