# Caroline

Hi, I'm Caroline. You may have heard this is my website! It's true!

This section is about me, myself, and I. A sort of introduction to me.

Hi, I'm Caroline!
I'm a [non-binary trans woman](https://pronouns.page/@halotroop2288)
who used to make Minecraft mods, and (tried) to make video games.

My pronouns are She/Her, or They/Their/Them.
But I'd prefer if you'd just *not* refer to me indirectly, where possible.

You can also find an [art gallery](/caroline/art-gallery) of [my fursona](caroline/fursona),
and links to my Minecraft server (when it's available),
and my [Revolt](/revolt.html) chat.

???+ info "Social Media"
    If you feel so inclined, you can follow me on social media,
    where I will make updates far more frequently, as it takes way less effort!<br/>
    I used to be very active on Twitter, but with the way things are going in
    November 2022, I won't be for much longer! Try Mastodon!
