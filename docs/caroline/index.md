# Caroline

Hi, I'm Caroline, and this is my website. :caroline-smile:

I'm a non-binary trans woman
who used to make Minecraft mods,
and (tried) to make video games.

My [pronouns] are She/Her.
But I'd prefer if you'd just *not* refer to me indirectly, where possible.

I am a virtual sandbox enthusiast.
I used to mod games (mostly Minecraft), and designed my own games sometimes.
But [I never found any happiness in it.](projects/dead/#Retirement_from_programming)

This section is about me, myself, and I. A sort of introduction to me.
In the following sections, you can find out more about my life by
<!-- reading my [blog], -->
checkout out [my fursona] and other characters,
and reading about my [projects](projects),
both the alive, and the [dead](projects/dead)!

There's also an [art gallery](art-gallery)
of [my fursona]<!--, my [blog]-->
and in case you want to chat, [here's a link](https://rvlt.gg/EmND69QW)
to my [Revolt](https://revolt.chat) guild.

If none of that suits your fancy, you can still follow me on social media, below.

    If you feel so inclined, you can follow me on social media,
    where I will make updates far more frequently, as it takes way less effort!

    I used to be very active on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ha1otroop2288),
    but with the way things are going in November 2022,
    I won't be for much longer! Try Mastodon!
