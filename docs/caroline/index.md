# Caroline

Hi, I'm Caroline. You may have heard this is my website! It's true!

This section is about me, myself, and I. A sort of introduction to me.

Hi, I'm Caroline!
I'm a [non-binary trans woman](/caroline/pronouns) who makes Minecraft mods,
and (tries) to make video games.

My pronouns are She/Her, or They/Their/Them.
But I'd prefer if you'd just *not* refer to me indirectly, where possible.

You can also find an [art gallery](/caroline/art-gallery) of [my fursona](caroline/fursona),
and links to my Minecraft server (when it's available),
and my [Revolt](/revolt.html) chat.
