# Caroline

Hi, I'm Caroline. You may have heard this is my website! It's true!

I'm a [non-binary trans woman](https://pronouns.page/@halotroop2288)
who used to make Minecraft mods, and (tried) to make video games.

My [pronouns] are She/Her.
But I'd prefer if you'd just *not* refer to me indirectly, where possible.

This section is about me, myself, and I. A sort of introduction to me.
In the following sections, you can find out more about my life by
<!-- reading my [blog], -->
checkout out [my fursona] and other characters,
and reading about my [projects](/caroline/projects),
both the alive, and the [dead](/caroline/projects/dead)!

There's also an [art gallery](/caroline/art-gallery)
of [my fursona]<!--, my [blog]-->
and in case you want to chat, [here's a link](https://rvlt.gg/EmND69QW)
to my [Revolt](https://revolt.chat) guild.

If none of that suits your fancy, you can still follow me on social media, below.

??? info "Social Media"
    If you feel so inclined, you can follow me on social media,
    where I will make updates far more frequently, as it takes way less effort!

    I used to be very active on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ha1otroop2288),
    but with the way things are going in November 2022,
    I won't be for much longer! Try Mastodon!
