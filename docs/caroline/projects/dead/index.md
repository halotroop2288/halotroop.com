# Dead Projects

A good deal of my projects I have lost interest in completely,
or have proven to be too large for me to complete.
Documentation is still kept here for future availability in case of curiosity.

# Retirement from programming

In 2022, I've had an epiphany.
I've realized that I do not want to continue programming.
I never actually enjoyed programming in the first place.
I just really want to create things.

The big problem is that I don't get to create things.
Most of my time is spent problem-solving,
asking for help from people who only want to start drama,
and searching for answers online, only to be met with more drama.

The projects that I did work on were ports, remakes, and rewrites of'
existing projects.
I never made my own assets or projects.
I never felt that I had the skill, or the creativity to come up with my own ideas,
