# More Creeps and Weirdos Refabricated

This was an attempt to recreate the classic
[Minecraft] mod,
[More Creeps and Weirdos](http://morecreeps.com)
for [Fabric Mod Loader](https://fabricmc.net).

**The [source code](https://github.com/halotroop2288/more-creeps-refabricated) is not public, for this project, unfortunately.**

??? info "Why?"
    According to the license terms included with [the original mod](https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/minecraft-mods/1272354),
    creating modified versions for personal use is OK, but redistributing them is not.
    I would like to stay on good terms with the author,
    so I was going to allow him to review it first, and ask him for permission to release it.

    A relevant excerpt from the license terms of the original mod:

    ```
    1. REDISTRIBUTION
    This MOD may only be distributed where uploaded, mirrored, or otherwise linked to by the OWNER solely.
    All mirrors of this mod must have advance written permission from the OWNER.
    ANY attempts to make money off of this MOD (selling, selling modified versions, adfly, sharecash, etc.) are STRICTLY FORBIDDEN,
    and the OWNER may claim damages or take other action to rectify the situation.
    
    4. DERIVATIVE WORKS/MODIFICATION
    This mod is provided freely and may be decompiled and modified for private use, either with a decompiler or a bytecode editor.
    Public distribution of modified versions of this MOD require advance written permission of the OWNER and may be subject to certain terms.
    ```

## Goals

The recreation would have mainly focused on porting More Creeps to the latest version of [Minecraft].

I really wanted to bring back Guinea Pigs, HotDogs as a main focus,
but I decided to start with the earliest-added mobs from the mod instead.
Starting with the first release of the mod.

## Screenshots

This is about as far as I got.
