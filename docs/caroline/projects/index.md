# Caroline's Projects

This section of the website is about projects I (Caroline) have started
with the intention of working on them alone.

The main category will focus on projects that still have a chance,
but if you'd like to read about projects that I've given up on see
[dead projects](/caroline/projects/dead "Caroline's Dead Projects").
