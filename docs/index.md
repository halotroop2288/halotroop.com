## Contribution Rights

If you can improve documentation articles, I fully welcome your contributions.
My personal articles (written by myself, about myself) are to be maintained only by me.

With that said, this website is one of the few things I retain full copyright to.
I do not release any of the content here under any sort of open-source license.
This includes the articles, images, and other original assets.

are released under the MIT license, and are free to copy and use anywhere.
They will be labeled as such in the header.

Any assets imported from elsewhere retain their original license,
and if outside contributors add their own pages or scripts,
they may include a license in the header.
