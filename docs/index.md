!!! warning "This website is under construction!"
    I am actively working on this website,
    but many pages may be incomplete or missing information at this time.

This website is all about [Caroline](/caroline), the [halotroop] organization, and [our projects](/projects).

Up at the top you'll find navigation to different categories.
Over on the left you'll be able to navigate to specific pages in those categories.

**If you are not fully supportive of trans people,
or have anything against furries, then leave this site immediately.
You are *not* welcome here, *nor* on my social media!**

## Contribution Rights

If you can improve documentation articles, we fully welcome your contributions.
Personal articles (written by [Caroline], about herself) are to be maintained only by [Caroline].

With that said, this website is one of the few things Caroline retains full copyright to.
We do not release any of the content here under any sort of open-source license.
This includes the articles, images, and other original assets.

### Exceptions

My original scripts (JavaScript files), like most of my other projects,
are released under the MIT license, and are free to copy and use anywhere.
They will be labeled as such in the header.

Any assets imported from elsewhere retain their original license,
and if outside contributors add their own pages or scripts,
they may include a license in the header.
