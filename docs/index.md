# Welcome to Halotroop.com

Hi, I'm Caroline, and this is my website. :caroline-smile:

[I used to be a virtual sandbox enthusiast. I modded games (mostly Minecraft),
and designed my own games sometimes.
But I never found any happiness in it.](/caroline/projects/dead/#Retirement_from_programming)

This website is all about me, my organization, and our projects.

Up at the top you'll find navigation to general topics.
Over on the left you'll be able to navigate to specific pages.

**If you are not fully supportive of trans people,
or have anything against furries, then leave this site immediately.
You are *not* welcome here, *nor* on my social media!**

## Contribution Rights

If you can improve documentation articles, I fully welcome your contributions.
My personal articles (written by myself, about myself) are to be maintained only by me.

With that said, this website is one of the few things I retain full copyright to.
I do not release any of the content here under any sort of open-source license.
This includes the articles, images, and other original assets.

### Exceptions

My original scripts (JavaScript files), like most of my other projects,
are released under the MIT license, and are free to copy and use anywhere.
They will be labeled as such in the header.

Any assets imported from elsewhere retain their original license,
and if outside contributors add their own pages or scripts,
they may include a license in the header.
