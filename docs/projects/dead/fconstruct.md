# Fabricators' Construct

Fabricators' Construct was an attempt at rewriting the mod *[Tinkers' Construct]* for
[Fabric Mod Loader](https://www.fabricmc.net/),
managed by [halotroop](https://github.com/halotroop/).

[Caroline] was the main developer, and unfortunately got caught up in
small details too much to make any progress on the mod.
She was mainly focused on the registry system, which would have handled the creation of
many, many items that could be crafted in the mod.

There were also many complex systems in the mod that would have taken a long time to port over. But [Caroline] was not confident enough to complete them.
